The user can simply navigate through the UI and: <br> 1) GET all the landscape who's in the database<br> 2) GET a specific one by searching for name, flower or animal<br> 3) POST a new landscape<br> 4) PUT (edit) a single landscape <br>5) DELETE a landscape
<br><br>*Note: In Sweden, each one of the 25 landscapes has it's own symbolic flower and animal.*
